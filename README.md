# marchmadness-scraper
This is a simple python scraper script using scrapy library. It scrapes directly from the official website: [NCAA Division 1](https://www.ncaa.com/scoreboard/basketball-men/d1). 
You can use it for other years just by modifying the code a little bit ie. changing the date. 

## Running the scraper 
Use the instructions on the Official Scrappy documentation to run the project [Scrappy Documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html)
